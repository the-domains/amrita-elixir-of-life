description: 'Medicine comes to English from the Latin, "medicina" and refers to the art practiced by the "medicus" or physician. The Latin word itself may well derive originally from the root "media" referring to a middle way, or balance, since in classical Greek medicine (that which was known and practiced in the Roman world) health was a matter of balance, and disease was understood as an imbalance of the body. This balance could be restored by a "medicus" who would use herbs or prepared drugs to do so.'

Medicine comes to English from the Latin, "medicina" and refers to the art practiced by the "medicus" or physician. The Latin word itself may well derive originally from the root "media" referring to a middle way, or balance, since in classical Greek medicine (that which was known and practiced in the Roman world) health was a matter of balance, and disease was understood as an imbalance of the body. This balance could be restored by a "medicus" who would use herbs or prepared drugs to do so.

Our bodies speak to us on many levels, from physical symptoms to emotional and mental symptoms of imbalance.  One of the original tasks of the physician or healer is to decipher these messages and work with the body on all levels to restore balance.

****

The science of "treating" symptoms in what I will refer to as Western Medicine takes the path of listening to compartmentalized sections of the body's messages, and providing relief and comfort from the physical messages being communicated.  At times this system will suppress the symptoms, and completely ignore the origin.  

****

Eastern Medicine tends to look at the body with the knowledge that each system must be in balance, to work towards supporting the whole body.  Environment, emotions, and mental state are included in the diagnosis.  This style of medicine works more towards preventative health, and supporting the body's own immune system to heal itself with the assistance of herbs, acupuncture, massage, diet and individually created health and wellness plans.

****

Both paths of medicine are brilliant in the science and discovery of how the body works.  Each seemingly coming from the opposite perspective, to interpret the bodies messages.  When they come together, we will have the benefit of a truly advanced health and wellness system.  Ideally, a team of medical professionals trained in both eastern and western techniques, supported by a complete holistic healing center will be a wonderful evolution in Medicine.

****

Until then, we are the ones who must take responsibility for our Health and Wellness.  And we must be vigilant in our research, and seeking of new ways to nourish our Mind, Body, Emotions and Spirit on every level.

Commercials are just information that is created from the people who want to sell you their product.  And those agencies who are supposed to protect you, have long since been taken over by the corporations themselves through millions spent on Lobbyists.  Your Health and wellness could have been bought off by a golf vacation.

****

When doctors and scientists try to find cures for diseases without taking into consideration the Vibrational relationship between the physical Being and Source Energy, they are looking for cures in all the wrong places. If the resistance that disallowed the Well-Being to begin with is not released, it will show up in the form of another and another disease. Your cells, because of their connection to the intelligence of Source Energy, know exactly what to do in order to become the incredible variety of functioning cells in your magnificent physical body. And in the absence of the hindrance that is caused by your resistant negative thought, that communication stays open to clear, up-to-the-moment interaction, keeping your physical body at peak and perfect performance.
